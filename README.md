A small utility to download logs, photos and videos from the Paralenz Vaquita dive camera

Since Paralenz has gone bankrupt and there are some outstanding issues with export video files I wanted to fixed. I have created this utility to download files without the need for the mobile app. This should allow for some post processesing of the import files and maybe lead to other functionality like linking into subsurface dives.

I have a dream of just downloading straight into subsurface, having links to my cloud storage photos/videos in the subsurface dives as well, with the option for local caching of those links for a performant subsurface viewing.

This was reverse engineered from doing a pcap of the mobile app, so expect the same brittleness that goes with any reverse engineered API. However, I'm not expecting any updates, so this maybe has a better a shelf life.
